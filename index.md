# Empowering Scientific Discovery - For All.

The _ACSGP X WiNS Project_: Join us in our journey to build the fastest hydrogen fuel cell powered car in the world, and deliver quality STEM education to the Children of Baray, Cambodia. 
We aim to push the boundaries of Hydrogen Fuel Cell technology, with the goal of being H2GP World Champions in 2025, while raising funds to deliver quality STEM education to children of Wisdom Nest School, Baray, Cambodia. We will build a practical curriculum that complements their current syllabus and send apparatus to the school for them to conduct experiments that will deepen their student's understanding and appreciation of STEM topics.
