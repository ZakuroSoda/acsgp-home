## What the Competition Entails
Our project involves making a 1:10 RC car travel approximately 70km over a 6 hour period. The energy sources are limited to battery and hydrogen, and teams are given a cap on how much of each they can use.

## To Achieve The Feat
This requires meticulous attention to detail in the design, construction, and testing of various vehicular mechanisms

Key focus areas are aerodynamics optimisation, weight reduction and material efficiency, precision manufacturing using various systems and energy efficiency.

For this project, this will involve choosing parts carefully with an understanding of where energy is expanded. For optimal weight efficiency, we will also be manufacturing custom parts.
