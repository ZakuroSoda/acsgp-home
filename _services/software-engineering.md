## Pre-Race Testing
For this project to succeed, lots of testing and monitoring of race conditions is required.

For testing, we have built a "treadmill" to run the car in race conditions, and we plan to install many sensors and program microcontrollers to carefully monitor and optimise the car's performance.

## Energy Management and Telemetry

During the race, to ensure we can maximise our distance travelled, we have plans for an energy management system, and a remote telemetry system.

These two systems will show us vital data such as power output, fuel cell efficiency, temperature, and remaining hydrogen fuel. The race will require us to make many pit-stops, and these systems will help us optimise the pit-stops.
