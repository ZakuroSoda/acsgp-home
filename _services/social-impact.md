## [Wisdom Nest School, Baray, Cambodia](https://cornerstone-eastside.church/wisdom-nest-school)
We are collaborating with WiNS for this project, because we share the school's vision of providing the Children of Baray with quality STEM education. We first came across Wisdom Nest School on our service learning trip to Cambodia, and we have personally visited the school and met Dr Sean, the principle of Secondary level.

From November 9 to 15, we travelled to Baray, Cambodia, on a service learning trip, to see what we could do for the local community. We conducted home visits and delivered care packages to over 50 families, erected solar lamps, built pavements and raised money for orphans.

During this trip, we visited Wisdom Nest School, a school committed to giving children quality education for less than 30USD a month. It currently has 778 students from primary and secondary levels.

Wisdom Nest School was originally founded by [Mdm Esther Ding](https://christianitymalaysia.com/wp/missionary-tentmaker/), who has hosted many [previous batches](https://www.acsindep.moe.edu.sg/acspression-2024/term-1/servicelearningtriptocambodia/) of ACSians at her dorm, [Khmer Homestay](https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Hotel_Review-g1024989-d3181442-Reviews-Khmer_Homestay-Kampong_Thom_Kampong_Thom_Province.html) and served many at the [Solar Cafe](https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Restaurant_Review-g1024989-d5768033-Reviews-Solar_Cafe-Kampong_Thom_Kampong_Thom_Province.html).

**Currently, we are raising 7500SGD to help them procure lab equipment to conduct practical experiments that would help students deepen their understanding and knowledge of STEM subjects.**


### Our aim for WiNS is not just to *provide financial support*, but to assist them in *designing a comprehensive practical curriculum* based on their existing science curriculum.
