## Open-Sourcing our project, to distribute our knowledge on hydrogen energy. 
As a team, we are dedicated to our vision of creating a world where knowledge is shared openly and freely, enabling breakthroughs that benefit humanity as a whole. Hence, after the competition is over, we will publish most of our research and tools as open-source projects on a web platform, for anyone intersted in the practical application of hydrogen energy to view. Our tools will be our fuel cell testing software, telemetry software, and circuit diagrams.

Above is our tool, that is used to track car performance during the race. Below, is that users will see.

By making specialised tools like this accessible to everyone interested in hydrogen energy, we lower the barrier of entry into this specialised field, and allow more people to innovate, driving the frontier of this field forward.
