# ACSGP x WiNS

We aim to push the boundaries of Hydrogen Fuel Cell technology, with the goal of being H2GP World Champions in 2025, while delivering quality STEM education to children of Wisdom Nest School, Baray, Cambodia. We will build a practical curriculum that complements their current syllabus and send apparatus for the school to conduct experiments that will deepen their student's understanding and appreciation of STEM topics.
